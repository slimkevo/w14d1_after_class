Chosen Algorithm: Merge Sort

Justification
I chose merge sort because it guarantees a time complexity of O(nlogn) in all cases. This is a reliable algorithm for large datasets.  

Time and Space Complexity
Time Complexity:

Best Case: 
O(nlogn)

Average Case: 
O(nlogn)

Worst Case: 
O(nlogn)

Space Complexity: 
O(n) because more space is required for merging.

Testing
I provided three test examples to ensure the algorithm works as expected.

Optimizations and Improvements
This algorithm uses a easy readable approach for merging. Merge sort sorts the array by dividing the array in half and sorting them.

Suitability Analysis
Merge sort is a great sorting algorithm for this assignment because it guarantees a well organized average case performance.
